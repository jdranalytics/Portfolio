 about people having to urinate on themselves. Like, because there was no space, I could almost feel the illness and the sickness. But I also loved how in that same thing, in that imagery, he was like, I want y'all to know that our ancestors did fight back. And he said, a lot of times I have people that come up here and they're like, why did I ancestors fight? And like, they're angry about them. He's like, no, they did. I want you to know many people lost their life at this castle trying to fight back. To me, that was the most important thing.
