...but your reply was good :)
...I didn't even get a response!
2 weeks and no resolution yet
A little late but perfect in the end
A wonderful support. Thank you
"Above all, I have the impression that it was a robot who answered me ""do you have any concerns about the links?!?!?"" 
Frankly I didn't find my request that complicated to implement and yet it would be so useful, and I'm really surprised that no one thought of it before."
above-average and customer-unfriendly waiting times, answers are inadequate due to the staff's lack of knowledge of German, the information provided is not really helpful (our question was answered after more than a month, but did not provide any new insights)
Accurate Fast Perfect Thank you very much
Accurate information, thank you very much!
After a few days I found out on my own how to solve the problem. The response from support only confused me because they were telling me that I had to enter a series of codes to modify what I wanted and all the tutorial videos there were in English as well as the link that support had sent me.
All good, thanks for making it easy
All right, they answered my question.
all super and thanks for help
All the information was very complete
always best solutions and answers
Always very kind, thank you very much
"Always very precise.
Thanks Luca"
"Anitta was very attentive
Too good"
Answer the questions we ask
Answers take far too long, even for urgent problems. No phone support or very difficult to get a number. It cannot be the solution that you have to solve the problem yourself by creating a new account and being online for 2 weeks without a payment function, although only the 2-factor authentication should be removed and the test mode should be ended.
Apart from receiving emails saying we are processing your requests, I have not had any calls or concrete help. Not one advisor directed me correctly to resolve my problem. Today it's been 3 weeks and I still have no solution my payments are blocked, my bank account is in debit
As always very friendly and efficient
assistance on missed collections.
"At first it seemed like he didn't understand what he was asking. After several email exchanges, it was understood and although it could not be fixed because it is part of how the system is designed, it has been passed on to the team to see if it is possible to implement it in the future.

Thank you."
bad
Basically a nice chat but the answer was completely wrong. We hinted that it might be a fraud case and asked to check it. We received the answer that the money is safe and that we do not need to worry. In the end this is completely wrong. Now it was a dispute and we lost the money and we would have lost the products!
being a bit faster in answering.
Call with Italian operator
Cancel my Stripe account
Change your terms of use
"Clear explanations and speed of response, as well as kindness.
In this case, highlight that satisfactory resolution 

I would also like to convey, taking advantage of this space, that attention fluctuates a lot depending on who or who responds or what those internal processes are like. Either they are really good and remarkable or the information and resolution is zero. 
Thank you"

Contact me through my email
Could there be help in Portuguese
Despite the attendant's good intentions, I realized that the platform does not satisfactorily meet a need in the local market. Payment in installments is important for attracting new customers and sales. In addition to being confusing, the platform does not make stripe customers' lives any easier. Canceling right now.
Despite the responses, nothing has changed
Did not really provide a sollution
Did not respond to my question
Didn't reply to our specific question
Difficult when it’s already good 👍

Everything very good, thank you very much!
Excellent and effective! Thank you
Excellent attention throughout the entire process. I felt very cared for and respected as a client. It seems that Stripe values ​​us and that is not very common nowadays. Excellent attention from Leonardo and the entire team. Congratulations! Thank you for helping me in my management, despite the delay in approving my identity... which was a long time. Thank you.

Faster feedback would be better

Fatal...no one answers me...
finally everything is perfect.
first of all the waiting times are very long so the assistance is not assistance! Then they didn't solve the problem with Klarna, I asked for explanations for two transactions NOT MADE BY US FRAUDULENTLY, NOTHING!!! and so the installment payment service with Klarna was not activated, causing me significant financial damage!
First they told me that they were going to help me erase those beginner mistakes and in the end they didn't help me at all. I sent two emails and only one was responded to, making me need to emphasize the first unanswered email so that the response would be indifferent. I feel like I waste my time writing for nothing.
For my part, everything was perfect 👍
Further clarification in service
German-speaking support would be nice
get in touch and solve the problem
"Getting an answer on Cyberghost is a real labyrinth: you don't know who to contact between Cleaverbridge, Stripe or Cyberghost! This is incomprehensible to a common user.
If you outsource your sales/invoicing actions, this must remain transparent for the user: there must be only one point of contact from their Cyberghost customer panel."

Good evening, you don't really answer my questions! I understand your position, but the contact provided on the seller's site is indeed yours, so it would be appropriate for you to suggest to your seller customers to provide a specific link in such a case! In any case, thank you for your follow-up which deserves to be there!!! Very cordially, Frédéric.
good explanation, but no solution
good follow-up and support
Good handling of the file
"Good morning, 

This is the third time I have written, and it is clear from our emails that we have a big question that is not resolved. 

On two occasions I have tried to make it easier for me to speak to support by phone or make an appointment to call, but it has not been possible either. 

All the information to solve my problem is the same as what appears on your WEBSITE. 

Sincerely"
"Good morning, 

We have exchanged more than 8 emails, and we still have not registered our online payment service. 

Furthermore, all your emails have a two-sentence header of good words, which is totally unnecessary. 

You are not decisive. 

I have asked for a contact phone number or for someone to contact me and it is not possible. 

IT'S AWFUL."
"Good morning,
I received a response within 1 week which is satisfactory. 
On the other hand, I had no way to return to the ticket created, to be able to follow it, and see if it had been taken into account. 
Adding visibility via a dashboard with all requests opened by user would be interesting"
Good professional and friendly chat
Good service, quick response
Grateful very good attention
Gratitude!!! Keep going like this!!!
Great service and very professional.
Great work customer support team!!!

Haven't received an answer.

Hello, Naomie unfortunately repeatedly misunderstood my question even though I explained my concerns very clearly with case studies. I finally googled my problem myself. It has taken a long time. I expected constructive support from customer service.
"Hello, we are still waiting for the resolution of our problem of not automatically capturing our orders and no one is contacting us 
Please let us know how to contact you by telephone. 
Our email address easyfilter.piscine@gmail.com tel 0768550769 Waiting 
Sincerely"
"Hello. Specifically, I think the support has served me well. It is the verification process that has been a little more work because sometimes it is a little difficult to understand what Stripe is asking for and provide it.
I think there is room for improvement a little.
Anyway, you have helped me a lot and I like the relationship we have with Stripe.
Thank you so much"
Help was great, but I can not use your platform because most of the people that will pay are from Catalonia, and their browsers are in Catalan. If I can not choose the language by default, it shows the form in English, and that will be a problem. Thank you very much, and I hope in the future we could choose the language for our clients. Have a nice day
Helpful and polite attendant
helplessness before customers
I am definitely being a victim of discrimination by stripe. This is not an issue due to high-risk products, it is an issue of discrimination against certain beliefs. What a disappointment that stripe intends to work with Latin America, earning millions of dollars and at the same time discriminating against us. https://www.wired.com/story/stripe-occult-witches-payment-processing-sacred-arts/
I am waiting for a response
I asked for a refund and nothing
I can't get my money back
I can't talk to the customer
I can't think of anything to improve
I clicked on the Refund button for a transaction  transaction in the app to do a partial refund. It just refunded the whole mount with no ability to change the amount or any confirmation. On the website, the refund button  allows this. So I made a mistake because of confusing programming. This should be looked at. Support fitted it out, but it was really unnecessary.
"I contacted you regarding a problem, you responded by asking me a new question and asking me to contact you from another email address, which was done. I received a response from stripe, we cannot respond to you because this address cannot receive
messages!!!!!."
I couldn't resolve my doubts
I design and create my page and you redirect me to guides that are not at all clear for someone who does not handle code, the explanations are for a developer, you do not guide me where I have to do it if I use WordPress where I am going to do that, very poor The support should have step-by-step videos, they are not user-friendly at all.
I didn't know if the email was yours
I didn't receive any response.
I do not have any company, I am not an individual with a company. I regret having requested the service.  In Mexico it does not appear in the frequently asked questions that I am an individual without a company.  I only wanted to download files 50 at a time. But I could have done it 1 at a time with patience.  Thank you.  I don't know how to make him understand and support that.
I do not receive the help I request
I don't know how it could solve my problem and the app remained with the same problem and nothing could be done. Furthermore, this company does not have the necessary support to send money to the banks of the Dominican Republic, they do not know the banks, they do not know the IBAN code of Reserve Bank of the Dominican Republic neither the accounts nor how to send money to the Dominican Republic
I don't know yet what type of information you want. As booking.com works in several countries, the taxes are different. I contacted the Canadian government who informed me to never give out our social insurance number. So I still don't know what number you want.
I don't like that you don't have the option to have customer service in Spanish by telephone, nor do you put on your website that the first deposit takes 13 to 20 days. I have been waiting more than 15 days for the first deposit and this causes a delay for me. In my work I think I'm going to stop working with you and I don't think I'll recommend the use of your platform to anyone.
"I don't think everything is fine 
Thank you"
I don't think so, you do enough already!!
I doubt it, it's one of the best
I find it practical thank you very much
I found the solution myself
I got a very quick response but perhaps too complete for someone who is not an expert. I didn't really understand why this payment (the only one out of 200 since the start of the year) had failed and I was unable to inform our member who ended up paying his contribution by transfer.
I got only a generic answer linking to a generic process which, although necessary (I had to update a document) did not solve my problem, derived from having moved to and being registered as independent worked in a new country (Belgium). So my problem (wrong country  and address data) remains unsolved.
I guys don’t solve my problem
I had 13 disputes for the same product, all answered with the same evidence, I told support: that they were not all in my favor despite the aforementioned. And the support person simply told me that he couldn't do anything for me, that's unfair because I responded correctly to my disputes and apparently they are only resolved at random 🤨.
I hate your app it was useless
"I have a problem verifying my account, as I have a relative who is a Politically Exposed Person, so I still cannot launch my online store as ""Payments"" and 'Payouts"" are disabled. 

Every time I contact support, they say the same thing that the team is analyzing it and will get in touch and so far they haven't."
I have been sending emails for 3 weeks asking them to resolve my problem and they don't. The same thing happened last year, you changed the style of the Stripe page but it did not adapt correctly to the mobile screen, so I have not been able to use my account for 2 weeks and you have not solved it.
I have been trying to open a stripe account since October 17 and ALTHOUGH I GIVE THE RIGHT INFORMATION, you send me emails claiming that the information is not identical and YET THEY ARE.  Is it too much to ask you to be vigilant and look carefully at the documents I send you before telling me that it is not compliant please
I have had solution to my problem
I have had to send a request for help to support twice because they did not respond to what I asked. It also takes a long time to respond, with the commissions we pay to Stripe I see that the attention and support are not quality. The majority who attend do not have enough knowledge to respond most of the time at that precise moment.
I have not been contacted again...
"I have not found a way to do what it says, the only part I have seen is one that says that an invoice will be generated proportional to the time used for the month and that is not what I want.
No problem, I will assume the loss of the days that my clients take as I have done until now but thank you."
I have not got an answer yet
I have not received a response to my query
I have not received any response
I have not received any response regarding my question
I have not received any support
I have sent all the evidence in this regard and even emails from the client saying that she did not understand anything... this platform has not supported me in any way despite the high commissions it charges for its services... the truth is that I will not recommend it to any client operate this way.
"I have to say, I was surprised with how quickly and efficiently and with care my question/problem was answered. 
And for such a big company to do so, is even more impressive. 
You guys are awesome! And really, the likes of Google, MSFT, Apple and the rest, can learn a lot from you guys! 
Many thanks!"
I haven't received resolution
I just want a simple answer to why my account has higher rates than advertised on the Stripe website when I've had my Stripe account for 3 years. The instructions on logging in to send a message from the app for security are un-followable and borderline spam-suspect. Can you just provide a simple answer?
I liked the agility, the interested way in solving my problem, options on how to make what I want work and additional sources for execution. All important points! Even if my request is not resolved immediately, I still consider it to be humanized service that corresponds to what users need! Grateful.
I look forward to continuing with the stripe
I made two inquiries, to two different customers, and the topic was closed prematurely twice. I was able to reopen the post on one topic, so it's still running, but on the other topic there was no response and it was closed without comment, even though the customer ID etc. was there. Telephone support would be recommended.
I need an answer ! Urgently
"I need to increase my receipt amount to a minimum of 30,000,000.00 and I am only allowed 9,999,999.99 

We are a non-profit NGO and we have international DONATIONS.

We work with elderly people and people with high vulnerability.

And a Public Veterinary Hospital"
I sent an email asking how and when the Throne amount would be transferred to my bank account, but they only informed me about the 30 working days, they got my name wrong (my name is not Arthur) and the link they sent me so that I could check the process of the value being transferred, the link was invalid.
I sent you an email again
"I still can't log in.  Resetting the password doesn't work, I never receive an email or a link to reset the password. It can't be that hard, can it? The links you send me don't work, I don't receive any email when I click on the link from you.
Kind regards Esther Brennwalder, Caritas Zurich"
I still don't have the account enabled
I still have no solution
I still haven't had a response...
I still haven't solved the problem
I still not get a proper answer.
I suggested three dates twice, the first three were not accepted, and neither were the next three - this was explained as a technical error immediately after the third suggested date had expired. Overall very difficult in terms of communication, but in the end the problem was solved, at least. Therefore, between “Okay” and “Bad”
"I think that in order to have a telephone conversation with the user you should propose a call time and that we as users adapt to it since coordinating it through another email takes days. 
I say it since I am null in this type of things 
Thank you very much for your treatment"
I thought it was excellent attention.
I tried to ask the question in Portuguese and English (the first attempt in Portuguese seemed to me like they didn't understand). However, in both cases, even using examples, I feel like I didn't have my question answered, just several ready-made answers that I had already found in the questions and support links.
"I was left with no answer on how to receive payments from abroad, how to set up an integration with the memberkit course platform, or even how to issue an invoice to be able to sell to other Portuguese-speaking countries.
Your support has not helped with almost all of my requests"
I was unsuccessful in my request.
I was very well taken care of, thank you!
I wasn't called at all
I went 6 days without payment, in the end the problem was resolved but I had to insist strongly for several days to find the service. I think you are too far from the customer. I still thank the last person who took care of my problem but what a waste of time, for me and you.
I would like to have someone on the phone
"If for any reason the time to activate the account is long, as has been my case; It is very important to communicate it to the user. Well, otherwise, it seems that: we have not done something right and we are asking DONORBOX for information every day and there is no response anywhere.
IT'S DESPERATE!!!"
If that's the case, it was great!
I'm still waiting for a call
I'm still waiting for a response
I'm still waiting for a response today
I'm still waiting for your call
I'm the one who needs to understand better
I'm waiting for the solution from you
In Brazil, the government authorized the use of a digital driver's license, a valid document that you do not accept. Please check the possibility of accepting, it is valid under Brazilian law. For this reason I lost 3 months, I have yet to receive my amounts. Support took a while but resolved my issue
"In my first contact with you, you gave me incorrect information so I decided to abandon Stripe and I have already removed it from my website.
For the second contact with Stripe I have to say that it was very good, but unfortunately the first contact ruined everything."
Incredibly quick and enlightening.
It can't take that long to answer.
"It didn't solve my problem. I asked about the policies of the partnership with AWS. The attendant said he could only analyze my issue if I had a turnover above 200,000 in 3 months. 
If possible, I would like to know what policies and advantages are offered to startups and AWS users."
It does not answer my question
It is unacceptable that Stripe, your company has an absurd policy and makes money by profiting from refunds, affecting the businesses that lose money by returning money to our clients by refunding money for double charging errors, I am very sorry for having used your platform, you have disappointed my trust for a few pesos that obviously I had to lose.
It is very difficult to have the appropriate information just to open an account. Correspondence by email only makes it difficult to provide nuance when it comes to explaining unusual situations. It would be very easy to speak to someone in person in our language.
It just not solved the problem, also not even detailed the answers, one line answers that only say the obvious, instead of giving solutions only give more problems to solve, just a terrible experience, I will need to try to monetize my website with ads because of this terrible dispute system that stripe has.
It may be appropriate to show specific examples when answering questions. The developer is expected to know everything, to be a full stack. I didn't find the answer I was looking for but they did their best to give me a solution. The service was definitely much better than MercadoPago
It took me over 2 weeks to reactivate my account, which was previously working. You only get a call back from California! After I was assigned German-speaking support, it was only back and forth via email 😕 I hope that doesn't happen again!
It took them more than a month to give me a response, I sent dozens of emails asking for speed and no response, I called several times too. Simply horrible and slow support, I ended up giving up my money and refunding customers. I would never do business with stripe again!
"It took three advisors for the last one to give me the right steps to follow. All very nice, but for 4 days my site no longer had a payment system. 
We get a little lost in the back office, it is difficult to find certain information quickly. 
Everything has been sorted, that's the main thing!
Good day,
Eric Le Meur"
It took you three days to reach out
It was clarified, but there is no clarity regarding the fee to be paid when an additional option is configured on the account. Let me explain: I saw the option to use my domain in the stripe purchase link, but it is not explained that there is already a fee for me, if I had known, I would not have configured this option. So I felt injured.
It was sick what they did there.
It was very friendly and great
It was wonderful, very attentive
It would be easier over the phone.
"It would have been easier and quicker to have had a conversation over the phone.
I didn't feel like my situation was understood. I rewrote several times so that my needs were understood. In the end, I have to start the process again with data migration customer service....."
"It would help me to know how to resend an invoice, when the person cannot find it in their email... it is complicated.
and when the prices of the products have changed, I don't know how to delete or change them, and I have to add more and the list becomes very large... and sometimes I make mistakes and they can't be deleted. 
thank you!"
It would really be a massive advantage for us traders/sellers if we could manage our own money. Even if we urgently need it to be able to continue working, please have the opportunity to get the money into our account immediately. Their system handling our money is not good for us sellers.
It’s clear, very respectful
"It's all ok; clear statement. Thanks!"
It's good although very strict
I've had payments stopped for almost 1 month. They tell me that I have to upload documentation of my ID and the non-profit club, I upload it and it is still worthless. It is not clear to me what documents I have to attach. I have attached all the documentation I have and I don't know what I have to attach and they haven't helped me either. I have opened several questions to support, but we remain the same.
Juliana was very fast and friendly.
Just be faster on the answer!
Just passed me over to Sendowl who said it was Stripes fault and Stripes said it was Sendows fault, typical blaming each other, about right for companies liking to pass the buck instead of actually helping a customer that has been with both companies for many years, time to look for something else.
Keep up the good work & collaboration!
Keep up the good work. Thanks.
Lazy service. In ll the time with Stripe this has never happened: payments arrive like clockwork, so this doesnt then just arrive a few days late. Sure, less important for you if its about €37. You'd make a bigger effort for € 37000 i imagine, neaning thesmall customer isn't worth the extra mile.
Many messages but they all remained the same.
Many thanks to Karina and Heather
Marta... I thought it was excellent.
May it also be attended in Spanish
More convenient “commission” rates
More than 15 days for a problem that is still resolved by your assistance. Fortunately, there are qualified people who have overcome the problem of creating the account. Truly pitiful! The person was friendly but the service incompetent. More than 15 days!

"Not only did they get monkeys to answer who had no idea what they were saying, but they made me waste my time asking questions so that in the end I told myself ""yes, it's a stripe mistake, we already knew it and we're not going to do it."" nothing to solve it. And they give you the recipe so that I can program things for you."
Not only do they not solve the problem, but they also maintain the relationship with scam companies. As a user I am going to extend my disagreement on the social networks of this platform, which does not give any security to purchasing users and which, on the contrary, benefits companies that commit criminal acts with their users.
Nothing has been resolved yet!
Nothing needs to be improved.
Nothing to add... it was great!
nothing, perfect assistance. Thank you
Now I have 2700$ to receive and a voucher to spend on the website 1000$ for you to release my money this is not correct I hope you release it to me because I have a friend of mine who has the same problem as you and we are going to go to court against you this It's not cool the money and my work
offer support over the phone.  Downloading more than ten documents, none valid, money lying dormant in your coffers because not transferred to our organization, no valid document when we have existed as an organization for 34 years and all this because you requested double authentication and that the person who had it left the company and cannot be contacted!
Our account was blocked for almost a month because email exchanges took too long. It's unacceptable not to be able to communicate by phone, especially when it comes to blocking our account! a brief telephone exchange would have allowed the problem to be resolved much more quickly
Perfect, punctual and precise.
Perfect, quick and precise answers
Personal attention in Spanish.

Please, I need someone to contact me so I can verify the DNI documentation and Registration Certificate of the majority partner of the company.

Resolve the situation that we have reported for more than 20 days and which only responds to us from different people, the same thing, without moving forward and apparently, without having control of the follow-up of our report, everyone asks us or requests the same thing, there is no complication between you and there is no solution for us
Respond to emails faster.
responds precisely to my request.
Response times are much too long. I waited 10 days for a response, and I've been waiting for a response to another question for 5 days. We are at the end of the recipe, this puts my project in danger. Can you please give me more attention? I need your help. THANKS
Response, fast, friendly and effective
Responsive and comprehensive response
Returns are a problem.
"SERVICE, FAST REPLY 
THANK YOU"
Since we suffered a fraud situation, it has been impossible for us to use the platform. Most payments are rejected. There is no phone or anyone with whom to have a fluid conversation to resolve situations. The entire message process takes a long time and is tedious in terms of procedure.
So far I haven't received a position on the transfer of money that is trapped because of the increase in chargebacks, you just tell me that you can no longer receive payments for my company because its risk is high and I already said that everything is fine, my problem I don't know when I will receive the money that is stuck on the platform, that's what I want a resolution about.
so long and without solution.
So slow to resolve my inquery
Solve the problem quickly
Speed, efficiency and explicitness
Staff seems unqualified
stil not solved .. 48 hrs so far
Still waiting for a solution
still waiting for my meeting...
still weren't able to solve our issue
Stripe doesn't understand that reev.com gives access to all its clients (charging points operators) to a Stripe account in order for them to be able to sell energy to Electric Vehicle drivers. The CPO in question cannot use the reev licence Pro at its full potential as Stripe does not approve the CPO business type which is totally irrelevant in our context.
Super fast support, thank you very much
Super responsive! Thank you very much 😊
Support has been great every time so far!
Support has not been resolved
Support resolved the problem when I looked for it, my suggestion is that when a problem appears in the documentation, pass it on… support should get in touch, even before the customer asks for support. The operations should be accepted with everything in order, so that the transfer does not take so long.
Sweet words, but there was no help.

Terribly pathetic case handling
Thank you - very helpful and thorough!
Thank you for the quick response
Thank you for your prompt response.
Thank you for your super fast answer!
thank you so much! It was all great :)
thanks for the quick answer, Johan!
The answers have arrived late, and even incorrectly. One of the responses even told us that they could not assist us in Dutch, the language of consultation being Spanish. It is the second time we have consulted and it is the second time that the responses are not prompt. The sequence of the questions and answers will surely appear in your history.
The answers were always friendly, but not always expedient and ultimately wrong. The payout to our Connect customer, which was communicated as successful, was reported as failed a few days after the last contact with Stripe in this context. The new payout was immediately successful within a day.
The assistance person who assisted me was very prepared, friendly and direct. He answered all my questions satisfactorily, supporting his answers with articles from Stripe's help center. I also liked that there was only one person to continue the conversation with me so I didn't have to repeat things and to avoid misunderstandings.
The assistance was very precise thank you
The attendant lacked empathy to understand the situation. How can I use the PIX function without developing and testing? The only way to do this is in the development account, because once activated in the main account, it will be available to end customers. There was no reading of the scenario.
"The case has been closed for my assessment without having responded to what was raised in my email. I have only received an email saying that my case was being reviewed, but without any conclusion. 

Furthermore, it is an issue that is repeated over time even though we have sent the documentation several times and have discussed it with the support team on previous occasions."
the chat person was ok and agreed to refund the abusive 7.5 euro Stripe overcharged me. But still the answer about the banks refusing SEPA when I provided evidence of the contrary and wanted the team to investigate so disruptions don't occur were kicking me in the long grass. Per email the other operator disputed hte settlement reached by her/his colelague on chat. Terrible.
The contact was quick, thank you
the explanation wasn't really clear.
The first answer was illogical and I had to comment on it again to receive a more accurate answer. Also, the time it took to respond to me is something. Stripe support before was much better, much more direct and was one of the best things stripe had
The first question, a priori, was answered but for PayPal I am left with my problem... I activated PayPal, I asked for Stripe to collect payments via PayPal and for more than 3 weeks now: waiting for a response from PayPal I did the steps correctly and I'm stuck...
The information we receive from stripe is not enough, we are very dissatisfied with the service, the provider Klinikare does not resolve our issues, we are not satisfied with not receiving the information first-hand, we are going to transfer these problems to our management to assess continuity with the stripe platform.
"the last 3 times i have needed support from you your support staff was never able to give me a coherent answer nor at least escálate my issue to someone that can helps. Its Been a lot of frustration going on and me going though the docs over and over and over in order to be able to get my own opinion of whats going on

At this point support has been useless"
"The only help was ""read de API docs"""
the path you sent me was no usefull
The people from support were polite and with good information. The problem is that Stripe doesn't resolve my business needs as I was expecting, so now I need to see if I manage to make several changes in my business in order to fit to Stripe or if I should look to other platform that fits my business needs.
The problem has not been resolved.
The problem is still not solved
The problem remains unresolved.
The problem was resolved quickly
The question has not been resolved
the response time was a little long
The return time for Level 2 was quite long, I waited more than a week. One of the people answered completely wrong, the other person answered me something more relevant. In both cases, it led back to the documentation without further explanation, which is a shame.
The Stripe Support is amazing.
The support is just bad. General questions about functions are answered straight away in the help area. There's probably no one available who really knows what they're doing. Despite an excellent internet connection, the chat breaks off so that you can no longer respond and only receive the summary of the chat by email. There is still a lot of room for improvement here!
The time to response is very long
There has been no call back to date!
There is no option to apply a withholding tax when issuing the invoice in cases where this is required by law. For example, withholding of personal income tax (IRPF) in Spain for professionals who invoice companies or other professionals. This prevents self-employed professionals in Spain from using Stripe.
there is no way to regain access
They could not accommodate my request.
They did nothing about the coup
They didn't clarify my doubts
They didn't even show up at the scheduled meeting
They didn't give me an answer to my problem.
They do not provide any type of solution
They don't give a solution to my problem
They don't help me with the request
They don't solve anything for me. A shame
They don't solve anything, they limit themselves to putting links with tutorials but they don't read our request. They also have a blatant attitude, that is, the cause of the error is our technical team, instead of cooperating and finding a solution to the problem. We've been having this query for months.
They have never contacted me
They have not contacted me
They have not responded to our request.
They have not solved my problem
They haven't solved my problem yet.
They never solved my problem
They quickly resolved my problem
They really need to solve the problem
They robbed me and I was scammed through a payment through this platform and I hoped it was a safe purchase and they could help me reverse this purchase but it was not possible they told me to make a claim to the bank who did not respond to my request either so the thieves who are registered on this platform they got away with it and nothing happened
They should be able to provide better support in Spanish for clients from Latin America, since not all of us speak English and it is very difficult to understand and it is very impractical to do it via email, and in translation the meaning of the conversation is somewhat lost. due to bad translation
They still haven't answered me why it takes so long for a transfer to Brazil (1 month?) We think it's absurd, other payment providers would charge a lower fee for only transferring the amount after 1 month. Paypal pays the money instantly, because stripe holds the money for 30 days? It's exaggerated, it could be 1% less fee since the money stays in your account
They were incredibly attentive.
ticket closed without responses
Timely and clear response.
Tip worked in your portal, but you should still change the general programming, because not every company in Germany has an HRB number and an entry in the local court. If this is mandatory on your portal and therefore everything hangs, customers will not be able to use your service and you will lose business!
To talk to technical support if you are not used to it like me. Exasperating when it comes to contacting you, they send you from one page to another or ask automated questions that are of no use to me since in none of the cases have they been resolved for me. I hope they simply put an email in which people ask questions and someone answers and not something automated.
Too bureaucratic to get an answer. I called 3 times, the first attendant didn't know anything, then scheduled it for Monday, then the guy didn't call, I called and then he called me, to clarify some basic questions. We could have resolved it via WhatsApp or phone quickly

Unable to solve my problem
Uncomplicated & fast! Thanks
"Understand the question would be great

I said multiple times that my ID has both my legal name and my chosen one, I send pictures and in the end what I was told was ""the name informed is wrong""

It looks like you didn't even try to understand

I won't be able to use this service"
Unfortunately my issue still hasn't been resolved after days. The response is always generic and I need to send more information. It's like people don't check the details. I just need to change the API to an earlier version, which has to be done by support. There is no this option on the website.
Unfortunately there was no response at all to our request. The customer wanted to pay and there was no feedback from you. We had to pay 7.50 euros in fees and had no opportunity to intervene because we were informed too late and later received no communication from you. Very bad service
"Unfortunately, I don't find support that only works via e-mail optimal! It's an urgent payment and I always receive replies from Stripe days later! 
In addition, my problem is never addressed directly; I am always directed to the left!"
Unfortunately, they were not able to locate the purchase through the gateway despite the information that was requested and provided, nor did they send me the information of the owner of the company to be able to complain to him, in conclusion I must make the incident to the bank to report the purchase, which block my card and etc.
Unprepared staff, poor service
Until now I have not received my refund.
Very automated. If the bot does not understand, it generates many delays and lost sales. I sent an email on a Friday afternoon. The bot rejected the verification and only on Monday did they communicate by email without resolving anything, the night I was able to log into the account. 72 hours without solving a fairly simple problem too.
Very clear, quickly, no doubts
very complicated I think I'll cancel
Very courteous and helpful. Thank you!
Very easy to contact support, the interactive chat is a pleasure compared to PayPal... On the other hand, my file took a little time to be resolved, and I had no feedback during its resolution so it doesn't matter confident for the first interaction with support. For next time I will know
Very fast and efficient response
Very fast and simple to understand
Very friendly and efficient operator
Very friendly and efficient!!!

Very polite and efficient attendant
very professional and attentive, thank you
Very professional and friendly team, thank you
Very quick response, congratulations.
Very responsive and very complete thank you
Very responsive to resolve my request
Very slow and difficult to contact
very well attended thank you
We couldn't solve the problem.
We did have a response from your support team, we can say that it actually answers our question, but we would have preferred to obtain concrete action that takes our expectations into account, even if the delay is quite long!! But we must recognize that the team is very responsive, bravo for this point!
We had a big problem migrating SEPA direct debits from one Stripe account to another Stripe account. Your only response was to say that it is not possible, even though we were not warned. We have 2,300 customers and more than 51,000 euros blocked. Lamentable!
We had to call support 10 times, we spoke to different people each time we called and as a result, we were going around in circles, because each time we called and a different person answered, we were back to square one. In this process, we almost lost an important client of ours due to Stripe support's delay in resolving the document verification issue.
"We were referred to a contact page where we made our request?

Issuing product page -> Inquiry with a description of the business model via the contact button/form -> Reply by email with a link that we should send an inquiry with the business model via the contact form.

Waste of time?"
well done and thank you for the efficiency
When someone gives you all the details of their account in order to give them information about the problem of some payments that are in the account, you should give it to them, there are many of us in the company and not all of us have access to the boss's email, pass a security policy that that also exists
"Why are you making it so difficult for me and other users to delete an ad when the apartment is rented? Normally one click is enough. Now take a look at the instructions you sent me. I don't understand that and that's why I will
do not take a course."
"Without a doubt, Luisa was super attentive to me, in addition to helping me solve the problem, she gave me more than special attention and followed my problem from start to finish!
 I was so satisfied with this platform that I decided to buy the plan!
 I believe that if the service is good, the service is undoubtedly even better!!!
 Congratulations to her, she deserves it"
Wonderful excellent support ♥️♥️♥️
Word Press says I already have my website connected to a Stripe account. But, when I open the Stripe dashboard it says that my payments and accounts are suspended for financial risk reasons. It's just a blog site www.hotsahrppen.com I would like clarification and no one from your support team contacts me and knows my email. Very disappointed with Stripe.
Worst experience in the world. There is no rule that prevents receiving donations for individuals, and you are canceling my account. I got in touch looking for personalized service, and you didn't even want to talk to me to discuss the points. I migrated to another platform, I never use stripe again.
Yes, but not very clearly
Yes, I would like you to support me and explain what I need, regardless of the language, I have 90% written and spoken English, but it takes me a while to respond and it is very frustrating that after all the effort to explain in English the problem, do not support me to conclude with my doubts.
Yes, provide visual verification such as screenshots, report, document. Just because you tell me that you have verified that the system works is not worth it to me because I still have the same problem. I requested that they send me something visual where I can verify that exactly the system on your part is working, but they did not do so.
You did it perfectly, thank you
You did your best, and gave me  advice to follow the concerned bank.  I  want to that bank but I could feel psychologically they were not comfortable to solve with my issue. That is why I thought if stripe contact them will solve my problem. But again stripe advice me to contact the bank. And I didn't like their manner
You didn't answer my question
You didn't help at all.
You force service via form and completely cut off service via chat or telephone. When it comes to something that involves configuration, more direct assistance is very necessary. Bad experience for anyone arriving looking for assistance. I gave up and gave my client another option, with more direct service.
You go back on your word. regrettable
You guys are perfect. Thanks
You have not given me my money
You have not solved my problem
You have not solved my problem.
You never got back to me....
You quickly helped me out. THANKS
You were clear and available.
